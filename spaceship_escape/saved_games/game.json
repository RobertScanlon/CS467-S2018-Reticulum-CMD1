Congratulations, but are you sure you don't want to extend your stay? I hear there is more galactic stew in the Mess Hall tonight. Anyway, as you look around the first thing you notice are the panoramic windows which encircle this small space. As you look out upon the vast array of stars, you can sense that your home planet is out there waiting for you. Just below this ring of windows there is a set of control instruments with numerous switches and buttons. As you look straight up there appears to be a hatch which reminds you of those from old submarine movies back home. As you continue to look around you notice there are very few supplies that would be needed for a long journey. There does not seem to be any sort of navigation system and there does not seem to be a supply of food.", "short": ["Escape Pod short 1", "Escape Pod short 2", "Escape Pod short 3"], "which_short": 0, "inventory": [{"name": "plant", "description": "this is an alien plant"}, {"name": "key", "description": "this is the key to the pod"}], "exits": ["Loading Dock"], "locks": {"Loading Dock": false}, "feature1keys": [], "feature2keys": [], "examinable_objects": {}}, "timeSaved": 1525654889.436338}
