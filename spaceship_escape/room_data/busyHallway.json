Well at least for now… Wow this space is packed with aliens going in both directions, towards and away from the Mess Hall. There is actually a water cooler in a little nook on the side of the hallway. Two alien’s seem to be having an animated conversation, you imagine what it could be about. As you peer further down the hall, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible you see that there are no other doors or openings along either side of the hallway. The only exits are the passage to the Mess Hall and a passage to another room, which you learn from eavesdropping is the Station Control Room. Oh no, aliens are starting to look at you funny. In order to proceed you may need to look busy!",
