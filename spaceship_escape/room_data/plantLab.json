As you look into the space ahead of you, you see rows upon rows of hydroponically grown plants, set in narrow troughs that encircle the room. Most of these plants look like vines which may be found on Earth. In fact, you may think you were back at your Uncle Phil’s backyard greenhouse in Ohio if it weren’t for the fact that you just passed a Glubtomium reactor on your way in! However, as you continue to explore something catches your eye. In the corner of the room is a desk, upon which sits a grouping and small potted plants. These plants look like basil which might grown in your window back on Earth, except for the shimmering purple leaves, which have an almost holographic property. Next to these plants is a small notebook. Maybe is describes what these plants are. As you look back over your shoulder to keep a lookout for aliens, you see the exit back to the Energy Generation Plan through a tangle of vines.",
