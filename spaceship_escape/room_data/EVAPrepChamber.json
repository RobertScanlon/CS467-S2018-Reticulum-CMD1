Whew thats a mouthful, from now on lets just call it the EVA Prep Chamber, k? Just after you enter you notice that the door quickly closed behind you and makes a tight seal with the door frame. Lucky for the rest of the crew, because on one wall of the room is a hatch labeled ‘Space’. Now your starting to get it, this is the space used to prepare for missions outside of the safety of the ship. On the wall you see a row of alien space suits hanging neatly in a line. You see one that may possibly fit you. Good to know in case you want to venture outside the ship! The rest of this space is very sparse, you realize this is because the room is subject to the vacuum of space when the hatch to outer-space is opened. You take note of the two sturdy doors on either side of the space labeled Energy Generation Plant and Loading Dock.",

One leads to the Energy Generation Plant, while the other leads to the Loading Dock. A hatch to the vast nothingness of outer-space is also found here.",
