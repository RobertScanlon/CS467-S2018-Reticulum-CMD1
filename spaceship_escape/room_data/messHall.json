If you were not lightyears from home, a hostage of some strange alien species, you might seriously mistake this place for your old High School cafeteria. The room is well lit and you can see a few small groups of aliens huddled around a few circular tables spread throughout the space. Lucky for you they seem to be busy with their meals and do not acknowledge your entrance. On the wall are an array of display screens. One is displaying what looks like current information about the spaceship while another is showing what appears to be an alien football match. As you look around you notice a serving counter set in front of the wall adjacent to you. There are prepared meals set out on serving trays suggesting this is a self-serve establishment.",
