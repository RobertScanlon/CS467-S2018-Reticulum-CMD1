You ponder for a second the fact that these aliens are advanced enough to traverse the galaxy yet still have a need for sleep. OK enough philosophizing. Suspended from the ceiling are a series of hammock-like structures. It's like an alien summer camp! As you scan the room you see that most of the walls are fitted with large panoramic windows. After taking in the scenery of the vastness of space that lies before you, you notice that since there is only one exit from this room (back to the Mess Hall), that the Sleeping Quarters must be at one end of the whole ship.",
