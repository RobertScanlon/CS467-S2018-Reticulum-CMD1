Sorry, just go with it, I can’t always come up with the most fun names, but hey, its descriptive isn’t it? From here you can see the Escape Pod, positioned at the far west end of the ship. As you maneuver your way toward the pod you notice a series of clamp-like objects positioned between the Pod and the main ship. Hm, you may want to check into those a little more closely! You look back to see the expanse of space between you and the Space Near EVA Chamber.",
