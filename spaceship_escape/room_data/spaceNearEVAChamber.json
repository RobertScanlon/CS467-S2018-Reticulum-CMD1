Now lets see, where are we, ah yes, you are in the Space Near the EVA Chamber. Behind you is the hatch which leads back into the EVA Prep Chamber. The hatch is closed but you see a button next to the hatch. Ahead of you lies the vast darkness of space. However, you see that not far away, although separated by a considerable distance is a protruding Pod sticking out from the end of the spaces ship. It looks interesting, you may want to find a way to head in that direction!",
