    "long_description": "Welcome to the Loading Dock. As you take in your surroundings you are happy to see the lack of aliens in this space. Not much draws your attention in the room except for the two heavy doors on either side of the space and a large <LOADER>. These doors are different from those separating the other rooms of the ship. Their size and shape indicate that they must be airlock doors able to withstand and protect the ship from the vacuum of space. The door on the opposite side of the room from the EVA Prep Chamber thankfully closes automatically! Just next to this door is what appears to be a small set of instructions and a big red <BUTTON>. You are somewhat comforted by the fact that even among the vast and diverse life forms that populate our universe, you are bound to find a big red <BUTTON> almost anywhere you go.  A brief scan of the instructions draws you to the words 'Escape Pod'  As you continue to look around you see another smaller door. Upon further inspection, you see a small sign on this door with a picture of what looks like a tool set.",
