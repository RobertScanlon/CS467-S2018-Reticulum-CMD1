Not much draws your attention in the room except for the two heavy doors on either side of the space. These doors are different from those separating the other rooms of the ship. Their size and shape indicate that they must be airlock doors able to withstand and protect the ship from the vacuum of space. The door on the opposite side of the room from where you entered is thankfully closed! Just next to this door is what appears to be a small set of instructions and a big red button. You are somewhat comforted by the fact that even among the vast and diverse lifeforms that populate our universe, you are bound to find a big red button almost anywhere you go.",
