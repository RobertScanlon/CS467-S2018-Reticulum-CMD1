You are nowhere else but the ships's Energy Generation Plant. It is here that the massive amounts of energy needed to traverse the galaxy, and keep the aliens alive and comfortable, is generated. Within each of the glowing pillars is a Glubtomuim reactor. Using nothing but save, abundant, every day Glubtomium, these devices generate all the power the aliens will ever need. Maybe don't stand too close to them OK? Directly behind you is the passage back to the Station Control Room. Across the room is a heavy door labeled 'EVA'. On the wall across from the Glubtomium reactors is a much smaller door. On the front of this smaller door is a picture of what reminds you of a cactus on Earth, maybe it's a passage to New Mexico!",
