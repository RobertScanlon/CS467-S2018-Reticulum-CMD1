As you walk around the space, you pass racks and racks or miscellaneous materials and supplies. Some look familiar, there are coils of wire and electrical connectors, while other’s are definitely alien. There are a few jars filled with a glowing substance which looks like the Glubtomium from the Energy Generation Plant. Don’t worry its completely safe...but eh maybe don’t stand that close. You begin to think that there may be some useful items in the room to help you in your escape! As you walk around you notice three things in particular, a handheld toolset, a fire extinguisher, and stack of barrels which you cannot see inside. Amid the clutter of the room, you can see the exit to the Loading Dock behind you.",
