Another thing you have come to realize on this journey is that sleeping on the job is a truly universal phenomenon. Next to the sleeping alien is a complex row of control structures including screens, buttons, and switches. Just above these structures is a large rectangular window that look out to space. From this vantage point you can also see some other parts of the spaceship. In a corner of the room there is a long rectangular desk covered in what appears to be sheets of paper almost as big as the desk itself. Devices reminiscent of pencils and straight edges are scattered on top of these sheets.",
