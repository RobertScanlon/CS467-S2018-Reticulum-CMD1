    "long_description": "So are you excited to find out what lies beyond the Blue Room from the Mess Hall? You should be, because you are now in the Virtual Reality (VR) chamber. You see, these aliens are not captive on this ship like you, this is their only home as they traverse the galaxy. Therefore, they often get bored or looking at the same dozen or so rooms that make up the ship, and only interacting with the same group of happy smiling alien faces. In order to escape from this boredom, our crafty alien friends built this VR chamber in order to ‘escape’ from this day-to-day, lightyear-to-lightyear monotony. As you scan the  space you notice that there are no windows in this room and a dimly glowing grey membrane covers the walls and ceiling. It reminds you of grade-school field trips to the planetarium before they started the projection of the stars. In the center of the room is a row of seats. The seats look sturdy and comfortable, like those in a well equipped movie theater. Just in front of the center seat is a small control panel, which contains a prominently placed button which reminds you of the old ‘play’ buttons found on your DVD player at home. You also noticed that the Blue Door from the Mess Hall closed behind you, but you can see the faint outline of where the exit is.",
